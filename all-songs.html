	<h1>Tips for Minecraft</h1>
<ul>
<li>1. Only craft one wooden tool (pickaxe), and get stone with it for other tools!<br> Don't waste your wooden planks on spades, axes or swords!</li>
<li>.2 Never dig straight down as you can fall into a ravine or an underground lake of lava!</li>
<li>.3 Never dig straight up unless you have an iron or diamond shovel in your hotbar,<br> since gravel and sand will suffocate you in a matter of seconds. That's why you need to be quick with the shovel!</li>
<li>.4 Found Diamond? Make sure it's not touching any lava before you mine it!</li>
<li>.5 Don't even try to kill that skeleton as newly spawned in a Hard / Hardcore world.</li>
<li>.6 Don't waste food! Only eat that cooked pork chop if there is 4 or more<br> 'Food Nuggets' missing instead of eating it when only 1!</li>
<li>.7 Always remember that when you are are playing minecraft, there are creepers. You might<br> forget its existence sometime happily mining underground, and then you turn around and one is in your face and makes you jump out<br> of your chair as well as giving you a minor heart attack.</li>
<li>.8 Be 100% sure the skeleton will shoot you before you can hit it? Block with your sword when it shoots!</li>
<li>.9 If the creeper is going to blow up, and there is no time to get away from it, look at it and block! <br>Blocking against creeper explosions reduces a very high amount of explosive damage!</li>
<li>.10 If you are playing on hard / hardcore and don't want any zombies to break in, replace your door with<br> 2 fence gates on top of each other!</li>
<li>.11 Escaping a spider but cannot sprint? Walk backwards and punch at it, it's leaping<br> attack is faster than your walking speed!</li>
<li>.12 Don't do risky jumps unless you are good at it (example a small lava lake or a ravine).</li>
<li>.13 1 spider, 1 creeper, 1 zombie and 1 skeleton all coming against you? Use your bow on the<br> Creeper and the Skeleton to keep them away, and use your sword against the leaping spider and the zombie!</li>
<li>.14 Super scared of endermen for some reason? Wear a pumpkin, and put water around your house.</li>
<li>.15 Fighting an enderman? Hit it in the legs, this highly reduces the chance of it to teleport away<br> or behind you, or be tactical and pour a bucket of water on him!</li>
<li>.16 Escaping an enderman? Stand in water!</li>
<li>.17 Horde of creepers coming for you? Snipe them or flee.</li>
<li>.18 Make sure that the water 'down there' is 2 blocks deep or else you will still take fall damage.</li>
<li>.19 Eat rotten flesh, it makes you very hungry, but it heals up 2 food nuggets and depletes about 1 food nugget unless you are sprinting. Which means that rotten flesh is useful.</li>
<li>.20 Keep in mind that Poison cannot remove your last half a heart (kill you), but what the danger is about <br>it that it takes you down to so health that any mob that hits you or fall damage will kill you.</li>
<li>.21 Do you have no food on you but a spider eye, and your just about to not regenerate health and you<br> need to regenerate it? Make sure there are no monsters near you, eat the<br> spider eye. It will poison you for 5 seconds, but it will make you regenerate health again.</li>
<li>.22 Store your important items in an ender chest, creepers can not destroy it, and other players<br> cannot steal from you as it keeps each players items that was put into it, also<br> if you destroy it with items inside, you won't have access to those items until you open a new one.</li>
<li>.23 Only break an ender chest with a pickaxe with the enchantment Silk Touch, because if you do it<br> with any pickaxe that hasn't Silk Touch on it, the chest will break into 8 pieces<br> of obsidian and you have to get another eye of ender. The Silk Touch enchantment is only possible<br> to get on pickaxes, what it does is to give you the exact block you mine. For example:
Pickaxe on Stone: Gets<br> Cobblestone.
Pickaxe with Silk Touch on stone: Gets Stone, not Cobblestone.
Same works with Ice, grass etc.</li>
